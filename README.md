## Project Overview
This project leverages LangGraph technology to develop a comprehensive evaluation system for multi-agent simulations. It encompasses a suite of tools designed to classify content based on its structural properties, directing it to the appropriate quality evaluation agent for a thorough assessment.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into four primary components:

1. **evaluateEL**: Focuses on the quality evaluation of e-learning scripts.
2. **evaluateTP**: Concentrates on the quality evaluation of training proposals.
3. **routing**: Responsible for predicting the category of content based on its structural analysis.
4. **multiagent**: This component integrates structure evaluation, category classification, routing, and quality evaluation for the predicted category.

## Local Installation and Execution
To run the project locally on streamlit, execute the following command in your terminal:
`streamlit run [filename].py`
